  description_fonctionnelle: "<p>A wrong html page, but which could be correctly displayed, was not well pasted in Writer.</p><p>This is particularly disturbing because of the different  behavior between Writer html engine and the Firefox one : Gecko. Gecko display the value contained between 2 unknowns tags. For instance :</p><ul><li> &quot;&lt;unknown&gt;sample&lt;/unknown&gt;&quot; =&gt; &quot;sample&quot;</li></ul><p>But OpenOffice, in Writer only, ignores it totally. For instance</p><ul><li>&quot;&lt;unknown&gt;sample&lt;/unknown&gt;&quot; =&gt; &quot;&quot;</li></ul><p>The attached fix unifies the behaviors between those 2 engines. It was approved for Go-Oo, the Novell Community version of OOo, see the first link for the commit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
