  description: CVS (Concurrent Version System) is a version control system that can<br/>record the history of your files (usually, but not always, source<br/>code). CVS only stores the differences between versions, instead of<br/>every version of every file you have ever created. CVS also keeps a log<br/>of who, when, and why changes occurred.<br/><br/>CVS is very helpful for managing releases and controlling the<br/>concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. Instead of<br/>providing version control for a collection of files in a single<br/>directory, CVS provides version control for a hierarchical collection<br/>of directories consisting of revision controlled files. These<br/>directories and files can then be combined together to form a software<br/>release.
