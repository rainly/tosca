ArActions
=========

This small plugin, developped by Tosca Team directly, allows to include a list of actions into an Active Record.

This is mainly used to plug dynamically action into views. This is a
must-to-have with an extension system.

Example
=======

In your extension Model :
<code>
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  register_action 'link_to_my_action'
end
</code>

In your helper :
<code>
module MyActionHelper
  def link_to_my_action
    // link_to _('launch my action')
  end
end
</code>
