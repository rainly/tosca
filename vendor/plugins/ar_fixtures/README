= ar_fixtures

This library makes it easy to save ActiveRecord objects to reloadable files or fixtures.  ActiveRecord is required.

See tasks/ar_fixtures.rake for what can be done from the command-line, or use "rake -T" and look for items in the "db" namespace.

== This plugin is used to dump/load some records .
See script/config for more detail, and 
http://nubyonrails.topfunky.com/articles/2005/12/27/dump-or-slurp-yaml-reference-data
It's not the best solution, but it's on the way.
TODO : Puts dump elsewhere than in test/fixtures.
Fix maybe in the vendor/plugin/ar_fixture/lib/*.rb
