SafeDevEmail
============

SafeDevEmail allows you to set an email address that will recieve all emails sent 
from your development environment. This is done by telling the mail server 
(sendmail/smtp) the destination when sending the email, which leaves the headers 
in the email intact so the developer can tell that the email would have actually
gone to the correct address.



Setup
=====

To set this up you just need to add an additional setting to your mail server 
settings in environment.rb

Example Configs
===============


SMTP
====

ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :address  => "smtp.example.com",
  :port  => 25, 
  :domain  => "www.mywebsite.com",
	:dev_mailto => "developer@mywebsite.com"
} 

Sendmail
========

ActionMailer::Base.sendmail_settings = {
	:dev_mailto => "developer@mywebsite.com"
}
