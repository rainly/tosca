List of things TODO

Simple
- Confirm that translate works for strings in helpers

Testing

- Strict mode? Catch accidental requests that would return hash of keys instead of string (usually unintended?)
- Auto-detect "test" RAILS_ENV and enable strict mode

- Pseudo-translating tool. If enabled, override default behavior to:
-- raise exception on missing translation
-- prepend/append markers to confirm that strings are externalized

- rake task to find missing keys

Refactor
- Split up different parts into diff. tests / code for each part of MVC & mailers
